- Search/filter sessions and view quick summaries by exercise or date.
- Export data (CSV/JSON) for analysis and sharing.

## Tech stack 🧰
- Python 3.x
- Lightweight local storage (CSV/JSON)

## Why this project 💼
- Shows practical CRUD logic, input validation, and file I/O — skills used in data-oriented roles.  
- Keep modules small and testable so features can grow (charts, weekly summaries, SQLite backend).

## Roadmap 🗺️
- Weekly/monthly progress reports.
- Exercise PR tracking and simple charts.
- SQLite storage and FastAPI endpoints.
